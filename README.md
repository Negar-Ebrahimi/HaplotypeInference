Done:
* Try to find an optimal solution, using hill climbing method. [done]
* Try to find an optimal solution, using simulated annealing method. [done]
* Try to find an optimal solution, using genetic algorithm. [done: So far, it's working based of iterations, but convergence method could be developed]
* Try to find a solution, using recursive breadth first search. [done]

To Do:
* Try to find a solution, using A* search method.
